# St Raphael Health  
## Homepage & Core Pages – Visual, UX & Data Storytelling Brief (v3)

### Purpose of This Document
This document guides **visual design, layout, interaction, animation, and data presentation** for the St Raphael Health website.

All core copy is supplied separately.  
This brief exists to shape **how information is expressed visually**, with special emphasis on **integrating real performance data across all pages**.

This is not a static website.  
This is a **living, visual narrative of turnaround execution**.

---

## Overall Look & Feel

The site must feel:
- Modern
- Light
- Executive
- Confident
- Visually alive
- Premium without being old or heavy

Avoid anything that feels:
- Blocky
- Rigid
- Flat
- Dated
- Overly corporate

Think:
- Strategy deck meets modern product site
- Infographics embedded into storytelling
- Calm authority with visual momentum

---

## Layout Principles

### Avoid
- Hard rectangular sections stacked vertically
- Thick background color blocks
- Heavy dividers or boxed content
- Static sections that end abruptly

### Use Instead
- Flowing section transitions
- Soft gradients and fades
- Curved lines, arcs, and paths
- Timelines that move horizontally or diagonally
- Visual connectors between sections

The page should **flow**, not stack.

---

## Color Direction

### Core Palette
- Warm off-white / soft neutral backgrounds
- Gold used as an accent, never dominant
- Yellow and amber for optimism and momentum
- Orange for transformation and action
- Small, precise touches of red for emphasis only

### Color Rules
- No heavy red panels
- No full-width gold blocks
- Color should appear as:
  - Lines
  - Accents
  - Gradients
  - Icons
  - Data visualization
  - Highlighted figures or keywords

The site should feel **luminous and alive**, not dense.

---

## Typography & Spacing

- Modern, clean typography
- Strong hierarchy
- Generous white space
- Calm, executive tone
- Headlines with visual weight, not bulk

Typography should communicate clarity, not volume.

---

## Visual Language

### Graphics & Diagrams
- Custom diagrams instead of stock illustrations
- Flow charts showing progression
- Arrows indicating movement and turnaround
- Circular elements for metrics and stats
- Infographic-style components embedded between sections

Think:
Designing **infographics inside the page**, not decorating afterward.

---

## Critical Requirement: Scattered Performance Statistics

### Non-Negotiable Rule
**Performance metrics must be scattered throughout all pages**, not confined to one “results” section.

Stats should appear:
- Between major sections
- Embedded within narratives
- As visual pauses that reinforce credibility
- Repeated in different visual forms across the site

---

## Approved Core Performance Metrics

These are real, approved outcomes and **must be reused creatively across pages**.

### High-Level Transformations
- **$85M → $290M** gross revenue, **19% profit margin**
- **$18M → $190M** gross revenue, **12% profit margin**
- **$10M → $56M** gross revenue, **32% profit margin**

These should appear as:
- Animated number reveals
- Circular stat blocks
- Inline callouts
- Timeline milestones

---

### BMC Hospitals | Greater Houston

- 19% profit margin (from negative)

---

## How Stats Should Be Displayed

Preferred formats:
- Circular stat counters
- Radial progress visuals
- Inline metrics within paragraphs
- Timeline checkpoints
- Numbers integrated into diagrams and flows

Avoid:
- Tables
- Dense text blocks
- Long stat lists without visual framing

Stats should **interrupt the page visually** in a good way.

---

## Animation & Interaction

### Motion Style
- Smooth
- Subtle
- Purpose-driven
- Never gimmicky

### Use Motion For
- Drawing lines or paths on scroll
- Revealing stats inside circles
- Progressing through timelines
- Gentle parallax
- Soft fade and slide transitions

Motion must support **clarity and trust**.

---

## Section-to-Section Flow

Each section should visually connect to the next:
- Lines continuing across sections
- Stats evolving into diagrams
- Headings anchoring into timelines
- Arcs guiding the eye downward

The site should feel like **one continuous story**.

---

## Visual Tone Translation

Without changing copy, the design should communicate:
- Execution over advice
- Action over theory
- Outcomes over promises
- Stability under pressure

This is not consulting theatre.  
This is **operators showing their work**.

---

## Final Goal

The site should:
- Stand out immediately in healthcare and advisory spaces
- Feel modern, not trendy
- Feel premium, not old
- Feel alive, not static
- Be memorable, reassuring, and visually impressive

The experience should leave visitors thinking:  
**“These people don’t talk about results. They show them.”**
